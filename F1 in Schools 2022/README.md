# F1 in Schools - Team Radtek Motorsports

### Overview:
Hey there! üèéÔ∏è Welcome to the adrenaline-filled world of F1 in Schools! We are Team Radtek Motorsports, a group of coding enthusiasts from Noida, diving headfirst into the realm of STEM and high-speed miniature cars.

### What We Did:
Design and manufacture a miniature car using the official F1 Model Block. Armed with CAD/CAM design tools, our team of 4 students went on a journey to create a speed car that would beat the F1 in Schools track. We fine-tuned every detail, ensuring our car was fast.

### Challenges Faced:
Who said it was going to be easy, right? We faced challenges like learning CAD/CAM design, optimizing the performance of our miniature car, and ensuring it could handle the track. Teamwork was key as we encountered roadblocks, but we powered through with sheer determination.

One notable challenge was making the car AS Light as possible, with minimal budget, making sure our car hit the sweet spot of speed without sacrificing control.

### What I Learned:
This rollercoaster of a journey taught us more than just designing. We learned the importance of collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. It was incredible to witness how each team member brought a unique skill set to the table, making our collective effort stronger.

Moreover, learning about CO‚ÇÇ-powered vehicles gave us a little teaser about a course in physics and aerodynamics.

We also discovered that failure isn't the end; it's just a pit stop on the road to success. Every glitch in our design, every stumble in our code ‚Äì they were all learning opportunities that fueled our drive to improve.

### In a Nutshell:
Being part of F1 in Schools was a thrilling ride, quite literally. As designers, we not only learnt CAD/CAM Design but also we embraced challenges, learned from setbacks, and fueled our passion for innovation. We also received the "Best Reaction Time Award," proving that our reflexes were as sharp as our design skills.
Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for us!
